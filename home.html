            <h3>Project Name: Transit Frequency Heat Map</h3>
            <p> Description: This heatmap visualizes the frequency of passenger activity on the public
               transit system in Metro Vancouver area. We separated the map into different layers
               to display the change frequency over time. </p>
            <p>
               Challenge: We use GTFS data from Vancouver Translink for the data analysis. 
               This is an unfamiliar data format for us to bring data cleaning and analysis challenges.
               What model we had at that time cannot analyze the original data. We used Python to find and clean 
               the fault data and then complete the data analysis.
              
             </p>
              
            <p>
               Limitation: The visualization of this map has an unsolvable problem. The heatmap successfully reflected
               where the heat spot was in the same time interval but failed to demonstrate the frequency change over
               different times of the day. As a result, the map makes the traffic during midnight looks similar to the day
               A possible explanation for this issue is that the heat algorithm in Leaflet calculates each layer separately 
               rather than combining them. A more suitable algorithm or toolset may be required to solve this problem
            </p>

            <h3> Hospital Service Region</h3>
            <p>
               Description: This map shows the location of the hospital and uses the Voronoi diagram to determine the closest hospital to each location by 
               dividing the area into regions based on the set of points. Instead of directly labelling hospital names on the map, I added them in pupup boxes
               to simplify the visual elements, making it easier for users to identify the nearest hospital.
      
             </p>
            <p>
               Limitation: Voronoi Diagrams are based on Euclidean distance, which ignores 
               terrain variations and actual traffic situations. As a result, the map may not accurately reflect practical
               travel distances.
               Therefore, The map is only a reference, 
               the actual situation must be evaluated by experience of users
